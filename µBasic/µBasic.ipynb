    "    \n",
    "    Answer: The difference between a high and low-level programming language is that a high-level programming\n",
    "    language supports data abstraction (the ability to utilize various data types of a language in a way that\n",
    "    is more 'visible', or understandable to the programmer) and structured programming (features of a progra-\n",
    "    mming language that allow for a 'structured flow' of control through a program), while low-level program-\n",
    "    ming languages do not support these techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Give a regular expression that describes words that start with the letters 'a' or 'z'.\n",
